            <p>About me: I'm a nerd</p>
            <p>I am currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Math at the <span>University of Tulsa('27)</span>.
                I plan to pursue a Master's and a Doctorate degree in Electrical or Computer Engineering in the future.</p>
            <p>My first ever experience with engineering in general, like many, was building Legos. The first ever experience that I remember coding was in 5th grade, when I joined my elementary school's newly created First Lego League robotics team. It was block coding, but everyone starts somwhere.
                Throughout middle and high school, I joined many STEM summer camps and clubs, such as MATHCOUNTS and the Tulsa STEM Alliance Girl's Coding Camp. 
                In 8th grade, I joined my district's FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team (#7163 The Bazinga Project and #13806 Project Agnizab), where I learned how to code in Java and the basics of electronics.
