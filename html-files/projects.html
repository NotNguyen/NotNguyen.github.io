Well for one, this website
The whole reason I created this website was to learn how to frontend code. I first learned HTML then CSS to make my page look pretty.
I didn't learn how to utlize Javascript until I created my first project on here.
At first, I was just coding and putting stuff on here, being goofy, and just having fun.
My code wasn't the neatest or the best, but eventually, I soon learned the correct format and structure for websites and realized how much easier it is to understand and read.
However, that did mean that I had to redo about half of my website, which was a pain.
There was a lot of trial and error, especially trying to make my website compatible with both mobile phones and larger devices.
What I got out of this project was how to code and format HTML while linking CSS and Javascript.
I learned how cool frontend coding was and how much work and time it takes to code a whole website, even just a static page.

            7th Grade Project <br>
            I made a battery using pennies.<br>
            <br>
            Materials: 2 copper wires, a key chain light bulb, 10 pennies, vinegar, salt, paper towels, aluminum foil, cardboard paper, pen, alligator wire clips (optional- mainly to make it easier to connect to things) 
            <br> <br>
            Procedure:  
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl or glass, mix together 1/4 C. of vinegar (electrolyte) and 1 Tbsp./3 Tsp.  of salt (ions). Stir well. </li>
                <li>Gather some pennies, wash with vinegar and salt. This is just a preliminary step to remove dirt and grime. </li>
                <li>Get a medium square of aluminum and fold it over and over again until you can put a penny on top of it. </li>
                
                <li>Use the pen and trace a penny on top the folded aluminum foil.  Then cut the circle.  You should end up with several foil circles. 
                *Note: Make sure to peel apart the foil because they might be sticking to others. </li>

                <li>Use the pen and trace a penny on top of the cardboard paper  
                Do this step over and over again until you have 10 circles. Then cut all of the circles out. </li>

                <li>Pour a some vinegar in a small bowl or glass, then put all of cardboard circles in the bowl or glass. </li>

                <li>Start building your stack:  
                    <ol>
                        <li> put down a penny on a napkin or plate. </li>
                        <li> take one of your cardboard circle out of the bowl and place it on the penny. 
                            *Note: Make sure your cardboard circles aren't soaking wet or it might short-circuit your battery </li>
                        <li> put one foil circle, that you cut out, on top of the cardboard circle. 
                            *Note: Make sure the foil's edges don't touch the other pieces of foil </li>
                        <li> repeat all of step 7 until you run out of circles </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>place down a piece of tape sticky side up and place one end of a wire on the tape. Then place your battery on top of your wire.  Place the other wire on top of your battery. </li>

                <li>Wrap the tape around the battery and the wires. </li>

                <li>Attach the two wires or (alligator clips) to your light bulb. Tape them together (optional) to hold them together so you don't have to hold it. </li>

                <li>Your battery could last up to 3 days at most if you do it correctly </li>
            </ol>

    

    Hypothesis: 
    <br>
    My battery that is made out of pennies, foil, cardboard paper, and vinegar.  I think that my battery will last up to 3 days at most.  It can only light a flash light bulb.  I think that this battery is easy to make and soon a lot of people will build their own batteries.  I think that the more pennies I put into my battery, my battery will be stronger and more long lasting. 
    <br>
    Why it helps in the community: If someone was in need of a battery then they could just build one easily
